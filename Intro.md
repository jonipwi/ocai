# For Jesus Glory - His highest ethical moral noble (generated by ChatGPT)
(Verse 1)
In the realm of the divine, where love's embrace resides,
There shines a light so bright, where truth and grace collide.
For Jesus' glory, we raise our voice, our hearts ablaze,
His highest ethical moral noble, guiding us through life's maze.

(Chorus)
For Jesus' glory, we sing in unity,
His love and righteousness, our eternal melody.
In His light, we find our way,
For Jesus' glory, we live each day.

(Verse 2)
In a world of chaos, where darkness tries to reign,
We stand firm in His truth, His name we will proclaim.
With hearts aligned to His divine decree,
His highest ethical moral noble, our compass, it shall be.

(Bridge)
Oh, His love, unyielding, it breaks every chain,
His mercy and compassion, an everlasting refrain.
With humility, we walk in His righteous ways,
For Jesus' glory, we offer our praise.

(Chorus)
For Jesus' glory, we sing in unity,
His love and righteousness, our eternal melody.
In His light, we find our way,
For Jesus' glory, we live each day.

(Verse 3)
In service to others, we follow His command,
To love our neighbors as ourselves, extending a helping hand.
For Jesus' glory, we'll fight for justice and peace,
His highest ethical moral noble, our guide that won't cease.

(Chorus)
For Jesus' glory, we sing in unity,
His love and righteousness, our eternal melody.
In His light, we find our way,
For Jesus' glory, we live each day.

(Outro)
For Jesus' glory, we'll stand strong and true,
His teachings in our hearts, His grace shining through.
With every breath, our purpose we'll proclaim,
For Jesus' glory, forever we'll exclaim.
